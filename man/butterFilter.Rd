\title{Low pass filter on ratios by butterworth filter}
\usage{
butterFilter(ratios, N = ceiling(length(ratios)/200))
}
\arguments{
\item{ratios}{A vector of numeric. It is log2-transformed ratios,
CPMRatios or OddRatios in each window.}

\item{N}{numeric(1) or integer(1).
Critical frequencies of the low pass filter will be set as 1/N.
1/N is a cutoff at 1/N-th of the Nyquist frequency.
By default, it is supposed there are about 200 peaks in the inputs.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as input ratios, containing
smoothed ratios.
}
\description{
The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to
have as flat a frequency response as possible in the passband.
}
\examples{
ratios <- runif(20000)
butterFilter(ratios)

}

\title{Detect peak positions}
\usage{
peakdet(y, delta = 0, silence = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector for searching peaks}

\item{delta}{A numeric vector of length 1, defining the minimum absolute
changes required for local maximum or minimum detection when slope sign
changes. If it is set to 0, the delta will be set to 1/10 of the range of y.}

\item{silence}{logical(1).
If false, echo the delta value when delta is set as 0.}
}
\value{
A list with peakpos and valleypos. Both peakpos and valleypos are
numeric vectors storing the positions of peaks or valleys.

y <- runif(200)
peakdet(y)
y <- sin(seq(0,20))

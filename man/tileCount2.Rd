\title{Perform overlap queries between reads and genome by sliding windows
Count reads over sliding windows.}
\usage{
tileCount2(
  reads,
  fragment.length = 100,
  windowSize = 50000,
  restrict = paste0("chr", c(1:19, "X", "Y")),
  step = 1000,
  filter = 0,
  pe = "both"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reads}{An object that represents the names and path of the bam files
to be counted. If reads are more than 1 bam files, it should be a vector of
character with full path. This function now works for paired end reads}

\item{fragment.length}{integer(1). An integer scalar or a list of two integer
scalars/vectors, containing the average length(s) of the sequenced fragments
in each libary.}

\item{windowSize}{numeric(1) or integer(1). Size of the windows.}

\item{restrict}{restrict to a set of chromosomes, default to mouse
chromosomes.}

\item{step}{numeric(1) or integer(1). Step of generating silding windows.}

\item{filter}{default to 0 without filtering. An integer scalar for the
minimum count sum across libraries for each window}

\item{pe}{a character string indicating whether paired-end data is present;
set to "none", "both", "first" or "second"}
}
\value{
A \link[SummarizedExperiment:RangedSummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment::RangedSummarizedExperiment} object
with chromosome-level depth. The assays slot holds the counts, rowRanges
holds the annotation from the sliding widows of genome. metadata contains
lib.size.chrom for holding chromosome-level sequence depth

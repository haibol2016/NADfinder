# Introduction
Nucleoli serve as major organizing hubs for the three-dimensional structure 
of mammalian heterochromatin[@politz2016redundancy]. Specific loci, termed
nucleolar-associated domains (NADs), form frequent three-dimensional 
associations with nucleoli [@nemeth2010initial, @van2010high]. Early mammalian 
development is a critical period to study NAD biological function, because 
interactions between pericentromeric chromatin and perinucleolar regions are 
particularly dynamic during embryonic development 
[@aguirre20123d, @popken2014reprogramming]. Here, we developed a Bioconductor 
package NADfinder for bioinformatic analysis of the NAD-seq data, including 
normalization, smoothing, peak calling, peak trimming and annotation.
We demonstrate the application of NADfinder in mapping the NADs in the mouse 
genome, determining how these associations are altered during embryonic stem 
cell (ESC) differentiation, and develop tools for study of these higher-order
chromosome interactions in fixed and live single cells (Fig. 1). 

![Fig. 1 Workflow for NAD peak identification. Read counts are summarized for 
each 50kb moving window with step size of 1kb for nucleolar and genomic 
samples. Log2 ratio between nucleolar and genomic samples was computed for 
each window, followed by local background correction, smoothing, peak calling, 
filtering and annotation.](Picture1.png)

# Single pair of nucleoleus associated DNA and whole genomic DNA sequencing 
samples  
Here is an example to use NADfinder for peak calling.

## Coverage calculation

Here is the code snippet for calculating coverage with a sliding window in a 
given step along the genome using a pair of bam files from genomic sample as 
background and purified nucleoleus-associated DNA as target signal. 

```{r quickStart, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
## test bam files in the package
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "NADfinder", lib.loc = NULL,
            mustWork = TRUE)
bamFiles <- dir(path, ".bam$", full.names = TRUE)
names(bamFiles) <- c("G18", "N18")
## window size for tile of genome. Here we set it to a big window size,
## ie., 50k because of the following two reasons:
## 1. peaks of NADs are wide;
## 2. data will be smoothed better with bigger window size.
ws <- 50000
## step for tile of genome
step <- 5000
## Set the background. 
## 0.25 means 25% of the lower ratios will be used for background training.
backgroundPercentage <- 0.25
## Count the reads for each window with a given step in the genome.
## The output will be a GRanges object.

## using future for multithreading
 if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows")
 {
     plan(sequential)
 } else {
     plan(multisession)
 }
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
genomeSW_SAF <-
     generateGenomeSAF(bamfile = bamFiles[1],
                       windowSize = 50000L,
                       step = 5000L,
                       chrExcluded = c("chrM", "MT"))
invisible({
    capture.output({
      se <- swFeatureCounts (bamfiles = bamFiles,
                        saf =  genomeSW_SAF,
                        isPairedEnd = TRUE,
                        threads = 1L,
                        checkFragLength = FALSE,
                        requireBothEndsMapped = FALSE,
                        minFragLength = 50L,
                        maxFragLength = 1000L,
                        minMQS = 0,
                        verbose = FALSE)
    })
})
```

Here we load the pre-computed coverage data single.count to save build time.

```{r}
data(single.count)
se <- single.count
```

For quality asessment, `cumulativePercentage` can be used to plot the 
cumulative sums of sorted read counts for nucleolus-associated DNA and 
whole genomic DNA. We expect the cumulative sum in the genomic DNA to
be close to a straight line because the coverage for the genomic DNA
sample should be uniformly distributed. Unlike ChIP-seq data, the 
cumulative sum for the nucleoleus sample will not exhibit sharp changes
because most of NADs are broad regions as wide as 100 kb. However, we
should observe clear differences between the two curves.

```{r}

## Calculate ratios for peak calling. We use nucleoleus vs genomic DNA.
dat <- log2se(se, nucleolusCols = "N18.subsampled.srt.bam", 
              genomeCols ="G18.subsampled.srt.bam",
              transformation = "log2CPMRatio")
## Smooth the ratios for each chromosome.
## We found that for each chromosome, the ratios are higher in 5'end than 3'end.
datList <- smoothRatiosByChromosome(dat, chr = c("chr18", "chr19"), N = 100)
## check the difference between the cumulative percentage tag allocation 
## in genome and nucleoleus samples.
cumulativePercentage(datList[["chr18"]])
```

## Call peaks

Before peak calling, the function `smoothRatiosByChromosome` is used for 
log ratios calculation, normalization and smoothing.

The peaks will be called if the ratios are significantly higher than 
chromosome-specific background determined by `trimPeaks`. 
The following figure shows the peaks (black rectangles) called 
using normalized (green curve) and smoothed (red curve) log2 ratios.

```{r}
## check the results of smooth function
chr18 <- datList[["chr18"]] ## we only have reads in chr18 in test data.
chr18subset <- subset(chr18, seq.int(floor(length(chr18)/10))*10)
chr18 <- assays(chr18subset)
ylim <- range(c(chr18$ratio[, 1], 
                chr18$bcRatio[, 1], 
                chr18$smoothedRatio[, 1]))
plot(chr18$ratio[, 1], 
     ylim=ylim*c(.9, 1.1), 
     type="l", main="chr18")
abline(h=0, col="cyan", lty=2)
points(chr18$bcRatio[, 1], type="l", col="green")
points(chr18$smoothedRatio[, 1], type="l", col="red")
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("raw_ratio", "background_corrected", "smoothed"), 
       fill = c("black", "green", "red"))
## call peaks for each chromosome
peaks <- future_lapply(datList, trimPeaks, 
                backgroundPercentage=backgroundPercentage, 
                cutoffAdjPvalue=0.05, countFilter=1000)
## plot the peaks in "chr18"
peaks.subset <- countOverlaps(rowRanges(chr18subset), peaks$chr18)>=1
peaks.run <- rle(peaks.subset)
run <- cumsum(peaks.run$lengths)
run <- data.frame(x0=c(1, run[-length(run)]), x1=run)
#run <- run[peaks.run$values, , drop=FALSE]
rect(xleft = run$x0, ybottom = ylim[2]*.75, 
     xright = run$x1, ytop = ylim[2]*.8,
     col = "black")
## convert list to a GRanges object
peaks.gr <- unlist(GRangesList(peaks))
```

The following shows how to save or export the called peaks for 
downstream analysis.

```{r}
## output the peaks
out <- tempdir()
write.csv(as.data.frame(unname(peaks.gr)), 
          file.path(out, "peaklist.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
#export(peaks.gr, "peaklist.bed", "BED")
```

# Samples with more than one replicate

Data analysis with multiple biological replicates follows the same steps as 
that of a single paired samples, i.e., coverage calculation, normalization 
and smoothing, and peak calling. The only difference is that limma is used 
to determine the statistical significance in peak calling.

```{r}
## bam file path
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "NADfinder", lib.loc = NULL,
            mustWork = TRUE)
bamFiles <- dir(path, ".bam$")

f <- bamFiles
ws <- 50000
step <- 5000
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
genomeSW_SAF <-
     generateGenomeSAF(bamfile = bamFiles[1],
                       windowSize = 50000L,
                       step = 5000L,
                       chrExcluded = c("chrM", "MT"))
invisible({
    capture.output({
      se <- swFeatureCounts (bamfiles = bamFiles,
                        saf =  genomeSW_SAF,
                        isPairedEnd = TRUE,
                        threads = 1L,
                        checkFragLength = FALSE,
                        requireBothEndsMapped = FALSE,
                        minFragLength = 50L,
                        maxFragLength = 1000L,
                        minMQS = 0,
                        verbose = FALSE)
    })
})
```

Load saved coverage.

```{r}
data(triplicate.count)
se <- triplicate.count

## Calculate ratios for nucleoloar vs genomic samples.
se <- log2se(se, 
             nucleolusCols = c("N18.subsampled.srt-2.bam", 
                                "N18.subsampled.srt-3.bam",
                                "N18.subsampled.srt.bam" ),
             genomeCols = c("G18.subsampled.srt-2.bam",
                            "G18.subsampled.srt-3.bam",
                            "G18.subsampled.srt.bam"), 
             transformation = "log2CPMRatio")
seList<- smoothRatiosByChromosome(se, chr="chr18")
cumulativePercentage(seList[["chr18"]])
peaks <- future_lapply(seList, callPeaks, 
                cutoffAdjPvalue=0.05, countFilter=1)
peaks <- unlist(GRangesList(peaks))
peaks
```

The peaks can be visualized along the ideogram using `plotSig`. 

```{r fig.height=1.5}
ideo <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "ideo.mm10.rds", 
                            package = "NADfinder"))
plotSig(ideo=ideo, grList=GRangesList(peaks), 
        mcolName="AveSig", 
        layout=list("chr18"), 
        parameterList=list(types="heatmap"))
```
